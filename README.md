#### ![](https://github.com/quirozfm/TikTok/blob/main/Tiktok.png)
## This repository houses the files required for an extensive analysis of TikTok's data within a claims classification project. It covers understanding the problem context, executing EDA, developing a statistical model, and communicating the results to stakeholders.

## Table of Contents

1. [Inspect and Organize](./Inspect%20and%20Organize.ipynb)
    - This Jupyter Notebook contains the initial steps in our data analysis pipeline. It involves inspecting the dataset, cleaning it, and organizing the data into a format that can be used for further exploration and analysis.
  
2. [EDA](./EDA.ipynb)
    - The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Jupyter Notebook is where we dive deeper into the data. We explore the various features of the dataset, identify patterns, and make visualizations to better understand the data we're working with.
   
3. [Hypothesis Testing](./Hypothesis%20Testing.ipynb)
    - In the Hypothesis Testing notebook, we formulate and test statistical hypotheses to uncover significant relationships within the data. This helps in confirming or debunking assumptions we might have about the dataset.
  
4. [Classifying Using Machine Learning](./Classifying%20Using%20Machine%20Learning-1.ipynb)
    - This Jupyter Notebook introduces the use of machine learning for classification tasks. It provides a step-by-step walkthrough of applying machine learning algorithms, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance.
  
5. [Regression Analysis](./Regression%20Analysis.ipynb)
    - The Regression Analysis notebook focuses on predicting continuous outcomes. It guides through the process of choosing a suitable regression model, training it on the dataset, and assessing its predictive performance.
